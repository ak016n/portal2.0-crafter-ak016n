	<h2>What are the Long Talk Guidelines?</h2>
	<p>
		Long talks are to be presented in person according to the Symposium program schedule which is still being finalized.
		Each long talk will be limited to 20 minutes: 18 minutes for presentation and 2 minutes for 2-3 questions.  Additional
		questions can be handled at breaks/social hour.
		To help you prepare, your mentor from the Symposiums Technical Program Committee will help you rehearse/practice the talk.
		These rehearsals are a key to a high-quality result and successful symposium.  Please work diligently with your mentor.
 	</p>
 	<p>
		In order for the presentation to be effective, please also follow these guidelines:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		In additional to following the slide template examples previously provided, make your font style and size should be
		consistent throughout your slides.  Use San Serif fonts that are standard to Microsoft Office: Arial, Arial Narrow, etc.
		Font sizes should be 32 to 44 point for the slide titles and no smaller than 20-24 point for slide content.
		</li>
		<li>
		Do not use Powerpoint animation.  It will not show over the webcast as it is just a sequence of images.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Working within these guidelines will ensure that your talk and the overall Symposium is successful and will be
		completed with a minimum of stress.
 	</p>
	<p>Also, keep in the mind the key dates and deliverables:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>Complete and return your bio by 1/23/2015</li>
 		<li>Complete draft slides by 1/23/2015</li>

 	<h2>What are the <i>ignite</i> Talk Guidelines?</h2>
 	<p>
		Short <i>ignite</i> talks are to be presented in person according to the Symposium program schedule which is still being finalized.
		Each short/lighting talk will be limited to 5 minutes; questions will not be taken and will be handled at breaks and
		after the conference.  Because of the brief period of time, it is important that you stay on the schedule and 5-minute duration.
 	</p>
 	<p>
		The <i>ignite</i> talks, show each slide for 10 seconds and automatically advance to the next slide.
		Slide durations can be adjusted by repeating a slide for additional intervals.
		The talks should be 30 slides (with slides repeated to allow more time as necessary).
		These lightning talks take practice and rehearsal.
		To help you prepare, your mentor from the Symposiums Technical Program Committee will help you prepare the talk.
		These rehearsals are a key to a high-quality result and successful symposium.
		Please work diligently with your mentor.
